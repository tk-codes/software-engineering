## Project Management Method

1. Agile (eg. Scrum)

    - [ ] Domain model
    - [ ] Non-functional requirements
- [ ] User Interface Design

    - [ ] If possible, navigational/clickable prototypes - screenflows (eg. InVision, Axure)
    - [ ] High-fidelity design drafts (color theme, fonts etc.)
- [ ] Software Architecture
    - [ ] Subsystems (Deployment Diagram)
    - [ ] Interfaces & Layers are defined

#### Requirements to work package (WP)

**A work package** contains
- ID, title
- Short description
- Aceptance criteria
- Time estimations
- actual hours of work
- Priority
- Status (open, in progress, to test, done)
- Category (Epic)

*Recommendations:*
- Maximum 8 hours for a work package
- Allocate only as many work packages as it fits into an iteration. 

*Rule*
- Developer estimates the time for a work package
- Client prioritises the work packages.
>>> **Not vice-versa!!**
